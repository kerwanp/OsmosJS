## Comparison

### Fumadocs

[Fumadocs](https://www.fumadocs.dev/) is a React documentation framework with a modern design and customizable.

Osmosis is heavily inspired from Fumadocs and you will find a lot of similarities between the two frameworks.
The big difference is that Osmosis uses OsmosJS (instead of React) and AdonisJS (instead of NextJS).

If your documentation is already built on Fumadocs there is no real reasons to migrate as it is more a matter of preferences.

### Dimer

[Dimer](https://github.com/dimerapp) is a documentation framework built by the [the author of AdonisJS](https://github.com/thetutlage) and it runs the [Official AdonisJS documentation website](https://adonisjs.com/).
It uses [EdgeJS](https://edgejs.dev/docs/introduction) as the templating engine with basic Markdown support.

As Osmosis is built using OsmosJS it delivers more advanced Markdown features thanks to [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) and a better developer experience.

Osmosis is a great replacement as it is also built on AdonisJS.
