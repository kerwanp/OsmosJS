## Introduction

Osmosis uses [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) allowing you to use JSX in your markdown content to build comprehensive and powerful documentation pages.
It also provides a large set of custom plugins to extend the Markdown features.

> [!NOTE]
> Osmosis tries to stick as close as possible to the [Github Flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to keep your content readable directly on Github.

## Syntax

### Frontmatter

Frontmatter allows you to attach data do a document using the YAML syntax.

```mdx
---
title: Document Title
---

Document content
```

## Callouts

Callouts (also called admonitions or alerts) can be used to emphasize critical information.

```mdx
> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP] Optional title
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IDEA]
> Some ideas to guide users in a potential direction

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.

## Codeblocks

Syntax highlighting is supported out of the box using [@shikijs/rehype](https://shiki.matsu.io/packages/rehype).

````mdx
```js
console.log('Hello World')
```

```js title="My Title"
console.log('Hello World')
```
````

### Tab Groups

Subsequent codeblocks with `tab=<name>` are merged into tabs.

````mdx
```jsx tab="Tab 1"
console.log('Tab 1')
```

```js tab="Tab 2"
console.log('Tab 2')
```
````

```jsx tab="Tab 1"
console.log('Tab 1')
```

```js tab="Tab 2"
console.log('Tab 2')
```

## Package install

Automatically generate codeblocks for package installs with `package-install`.

````mdx
```package-install
npm i @osmosjs/osmos
```
````

```package-install
npm i @osmosjs/osmos
```
